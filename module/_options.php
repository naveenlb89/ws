                    <p> 
                        Waiver & Release: All participants must return a signed waiver & release form at the time of registration. This waiver & release form can be returned to the Program Leader, or to WorldStrides via email to: customerservice@worldstrides.org or by mail to: PO Box 9033, Charlottesville, VA 22906. A copy of the waiver & release form can be found at: https://resources.worldstrides.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/WorldStrides_WaiverandRelease_2016.pdf
                    </p>
                    <h5>Payment and Price</h5>
                    <p> 
                        Payment Plans: If you register directly with WorldStrides, there are three payment options: (1) pay in full, within 21 days of registration (2) make regularly scheduled installment payments under a manual installment plan established by WorldStrides, with a $6 non-refundable handling fee on each installment payment following your registration, except the initial deposit and the final payment, or (3) establish automatic payments to be debited from your checking account or a debit card from a US banking institution via WorldStrides EZPay program. There are no handling fees associated with payments made through the EZPay program. Your account must be paid in full by the final payment deadline as stated on your trip information letter or your account will be subject to cancellation. Price Adjustments: The price quoted is based upon a minimum number of travelers, the content of the program as outlined in your trip information letter and the date of your registration. The price quoted is subject to adjustment if the minimum enrollment is not met, if the program content or itinerary changes, or in the event of circumstances beyond WorldStrides’ direct control, including, but not limited to, increases in travel security charges, government imposed fees and taxes, fuel and energy costs, and airline, vendor, or group imposed schedule changes or delays. Combined Groups: If 1) your price is guaranteed for a minimum number of participants of 34 or fewer or 2) your group size is below the minimum number of participants of 35 or more, your group may be combined with other group(s) on the program. The combinations may not be of the same age level or have the same itinerary. If the Program Leader chooses not to be combined and travels with less than the minimum number of participants, an additional small group fee will be charged to your account. Program Fees Not Included: Unless specifically stated in your trip information letter, WorldStrides’ program prices do not include optional additional college credit fees, passport fees, visa fees, Full Refund Program fees, lunches, beverages with meals, baggage charges, expenses incurred during free time, porterage at airports and hotels, transportation from your home to the origination point of the program and back, tips to guides and long-distance bus drivers, or overnight lodging and meals in the United States prior to departure or upon return of an international flight. Late Registration, Late Payment, and Fees: WorldStrides charges a late registration charge, equal to the greater of 10% of the base tour price or $30, for registrations received after the final payment deadline. If you register prior to the final payment deadline as stated on your trip information letter but your account is not paid in full by that date, WorldStrides charges a $60 late payment fee. The fee for any late payments made after any scheduled installment date is $15. No personal checks or business checks will be accepted after the final payment deadline. There is a $35 service charge on returned checks, declined credit cards or declined e-checks. A $100 fee may apply for any correction made to your name within 75 days of the departure date. (For international programs, a $150 fee may apply for any changes made within 105 days of departure). Waitlist: Your program space is not guaranteed until your account has been paid in full and you have been advised in writing that all conditions for travel have been satisfied. If you are placed on a waitlist due to late registration or an outstanding account balance after final payment your account must clear waiting list procedures and may involve additional airline and other charges. Adults and Young Children: Adults pay a supplement based on room occupancy. If a traveling partner is available and hotel configuration allows, adults can be registered two to a room, for a supplement of an additional 15% of base trip price. For a single occupancy room, adults pay a supplement of 30% of base trip price. Upon all parties’ approval and subject to availability, adults may share a triple room for an additional charge of 10% of base trip price. There is no supplement (0%) for quad occupancy of a room by adults (other than Florida and West Coast science programs – 5% supplement) For Science & International Programs only - Registration for children 12 and under is subject to individual review, and the decision to allow participation in a trip is at the sole discretion of WorldStrides. Cancellations Cancellations: All cancellations must be made in writing by or on behalf of the person listed on the registration form to customerservice@worldstrides.org or via mail to WorldStrides, P.O. Box 9033, Charlottesville, VA 22906-9033, must be postmarked prior to the group’s departure, and must include account number, registrant’s name, and complete address. Cancellations may be initiated by the Program Leader. All refunds are issued using the original form of payment on the account in approximately four to six weeks. Check refunds are only issued to the primary responsible party listed on the account. Within seven calendar days following receipt of your registration confirmation or initial payment invoice (whichever is first), you may cancel your WorldStrides program and receive a full refund. After seven days, the Standard Cancellation Policy applies unless the Full Refund Program option is purchased. Full Refund Program (FRP) Benefits: If you, the Program Leader, school, or the school’s administration, needs to cancel beyond the seven day grace period, the Full Refund Program protects your payments and provides a refund, less the FRP fee and the Non-Refundable Fees listed below. If elected, the additional fee for the FRP program will be added to the trip price on your next invoice, and your next installment payment will be applied to the FRP fee, before being applied towards your outstanding trip balance. The FRP fee cost will be included in your trip information letter. All payments, including the optional FRP program fee, are due as of the final payment due date for your program. If, as of that date, the additional amount for the FRP program has not been received in full, your FRP election may be canceled. In the event that the trip is canceled as a result of or following acts of force majeure, including, without limitation, acts of God, war (whether declared or not), terrorism, or civil unrest, or in the event of WorldStrides’ bankruptcy, insolvency, or cessation of business the Full Refund Program will not make refunds and the below stated Standard Cancellation Policy will apply. Standard Cancellation Policy: If you do not enroll in the Full Refund Program and you, the Program Leader, school, or school administration must cancel beyond the seven day grace period, WorldStrides will retain · 25% of the base trip price (minimum charge of $120 if base trip price is $400 or more) if your cancellation letter is postmarked more than 75 days prior to the group’s departure, · 50% of the base trip price if your cancellation letter is postmarked 45 to 74 days prior to group’s departure, or · 100% of the base trip price if your cancellation letter is postmarked 44 days or fewer prior to group’s departure. Non-Refundable Fees: The non-refundable deposit, Full Refund Program fees, handling charges, merchandise fees, fees for returned checks, fees for declined credit cards or electronic drafts, late payments, and registration fees are not refundable under the Full Refund Program or the Standard Cancellation policy. For California residents only: Upon cancellation of the transportation or travel services, where you, the customer, are not at fault and have not canceled in violation of the terms and conditions, if any, of the contract for transportation or travel services, all sums paid to WorldStrides for services not received by you will be promptly refunded by WorldStrides to you unless you otherwise advise WorldStrides in writing. Registration as a seller of travel does not constitute approval by the state of California. WorldStrides’ principal office is located in Charlottesville, VA. This transaction is not covered by the California Travel Consumer Restitution Fund. You are not eligible to file a claim against that Fund in the event of WorldStrides’ default. For Washington State residents only: If transportation or other services are canceled by WorldStrides, all sums paid to WorldStrides for services not performed in accordance with the contract between WorldStrides and the consumer will be refunded within 30 days of receiving funds from the supplier with whom the services were arranged, or if the funds were not sent to the supplier, the funds shall be returned within 14 days after cancellation by WorldStrides to the consumer unless the consumer requests WorldStrides apply the money to another travel product and/or date. Extras Course Credit: Because WorldStrides holds various accreditations, participants may qualify for course credit for participation in a WorldStrides program. Schools, colleges, and universities hold varying policies regarding a student’s eligibility to earn or redeem course credit from other accredited institutions. Students should consult their school guidance counselors and/or school policy handbooks to determine their eligibility. WorldStrides is not responsible for the approval or issuance of course credit. Medical Insurance: All participants are provided accident, illness, and accident-related dental insurance coverage up to $7,500 for accident, $1,500 for illness, and $750 for accident-related dental. Pre-existing conditions are not covered. Any charges not covered are the responsibility of the participant. Other limitations may apply. Full details are available upon request. Participants are solely responsible for their pre-program, program, and post-program medical care in all respects, including, but not limited to, obtaining and taking necessary medication(s), vaccinations, and any other medical care and treatment. Frequent Flyer Miles: Frequent flyer miles are not available to participants. General Information Program Information Letter: Approximately two weeks prior to departure, you will be sent details regarding flight and hotel information, departure and return times, packing tips, drop-off/pick-up locations, etc. Travel Documentation: Every participant must have the required documentation necessary to participate in the trip prior to the date of departure, including date of birth and necessary identification that fully matches the name provided to WorldStrides for inclusion on travel documentation and airline tickets, and must meet any other applicable compliance requirements issued by the Transportation Security Administration or related agencies. WorldStrides provides online and customer service to keep the program participant’s information current and it is the participant’s sole responsibility to assure that this information is fully up to date no later than 60 days prior to the group’s departure date. If changes occur after that date, the participant must contact customer service and additional change fees may apply. Visit the Transportation Security Administration website at www.tsa.gov for more information. If a participant is unable to travel due to the lack of a proper identification, passport or visa, or necessary inoculations, the standard cancellation policy will apply. Reservations are not transferable at any time. Supervision/Behavior: WorldStrides, the Program Leader, and chaperones establish behavior rules and directions for all student participants. Failure to abide by the rules or directions may result in the student being sent home at the parents’ expense without any right to a refund. All program participants will be responsible for their own actions at all times. Participants will be required to sign a behavior contract prior to departure. On occasion, program participants may be allowed by the Program Leader to leave the group and to explore on their own. WorldStrides has no responsibility for participants when they are on their own and it is the sole responsibility of those participants to take whatever actions are necessary to rejoin the group, at their own cost. If a program participant is late in appearing for a scheduled departure, the Program Leader has no duty to delay the Program to wait for the participant. Program Leaders: Participants understand that Program Leaders and chaperones receive support for their work through discounted travel with their group, opportunities for additional educational and professional development, the ability to provide scholarships for needy and deserving students, and/or through salary or stipends. Personal Property: Participants are fully responsible for any costs arising from the damage, loss, or theft of any personal property during the program. Travelers with Disabilities: WorldStrides happily welcomes all travelers on our tours. However, the trips are fast paced, require a great deal of walking, and can be physically demanding. Due to these restrictions, you may not be able to fully participate in the tour. Furthermore, WorldStrides is not responsible for any denial of service by carriers, hotels, restaurants, and other independent suppliers, and cannot refund the cost of any activity in which you were unable to participate. We encourage that any disability requiring special attention be reported to the Program Leader and WorldStrides at the time you make your reservation. WorldStrides will make reasonable attempts to accommodate special needs. Travelers requiring extraordinary assistance must be accompanied by a paying companion who is capable of and totally responsible for providing the necessary assistance. Special Dietary Requirements: WorldStrides cannot be responsible for accommodating any food allergies, or dietary requirements and restrictions, and is not responsible for any problems associated with the same. All issues regarding food and drink, including allergies, or dietary requirements and restrictions, are the sole responsibility of the participant. However, participants are encouraged to communicate any special dietary requirements to the Program Leader in advance of travel, and WorldStrides will assist the Program Leader with requesting special meal accommodations from the food establishments. WorldStrides cannot guarantee that accommodations will be available. Trip Changes: Changes or substitutions in hotels, itinerary, inclusions, or airports may be made depending on your travel dates, arrival and departure times, national holidays, and events beyond WorldStrides’ control at the discretion of WorldStrides as it deems necessary or desirable. On certain dates some attractions or activities may be closed. WorldStrides at its sole discretion may cancel a program due to insufficient enrollment, unforeseen operational difficulties, lack of projected availability, or any other reasons at any time. Whenever possible, suitable alternatives will be provided. If a trip is canceled by WorldStrides, the sole obligation of WorldStrides is to refund all funds collected from any registrant minus merchandise fees. WorldStrides reserves the right to change the date of departure due to heavy demand on certain peak travel dates by no more than two days from the original departure date. These changes are not grounds for cancellation without penalty or for refunds after the tour. On occasion, WorldStrides must change dates of a scheduled program by 3 days or more. If you find it necessary to cancel because your program dates are changed by WorldStrides by 3 days or more, you will be refunded all monies, minus fees for returned checks and merchandise fees. Your letter of cancellation must be postmarked no more than 14 days after the date change is announced to the Program Leader, and it must state that the date change is your reason for canceling.

                     <p> 
                             I, the undersigned (or my parent or guardian if I am under 18 years old), a participant on an educational tour provided by Lakeland Tours, LLC d/b/a WorldStrides (hereinafter referred to as “WorldStrides”), hereby agree to the following: WorldStrides, its owners, directors, officers, employees and affiliates, your sponsoring school, teachers, chaperones and Program Leaders, (collectively “WorldStrides”) does not own or operate any entity which is to or does provide goods or services for your trip including, for example, ownership or control over hotels or other lodging facilities, airline, vessel, bus, van or other transportation companies, local ground operators, providers or organizers of optional excursions or equipment used thereon, food service or entertainment providers, etc. All such persons and entities are independent contractors. As a result, WorldStrides is not liable for any negligent or willful act or failure to act of any such person or entity, or of any other third party. Without limitation, WorldStrides is not responsible for any injury, loss, or damage to person or property, death, delay or inconvenience in connection with the provision of any goods or services occasioned by or resulting from, but not limited to, acts of God, acts of government, force majeure, acts of war or civil unrest, insurrection or revolt, strikes or other labor activities, criminal or terrorist activities of any kind, or the threat thereof, overbooking or downgrading of accommodations, structural or other defective conditions in hotels or other lodging facilities, mechanical or other failure of airplanes or other means of transportation or for any failure of any transportation mechanism to arrive or depart timely or safely, dangers associated with or bites from animals, pests or insects, marine life or vegetation of any sort, dangers incident to recreational activities such as scuba diving, zip lining, snorkeling, paddle boarding, surfing, swimming, kayaking, sailing, canoeing, rafting, hiking, bicycling, rock climbing, etc., sanitation problems, food poisoning, lack of access to or quality of medical care, difficulty in evacuation in case of a medical or other emergency, illness, epidemics or the threat thereof or for any other cause beyond the direct control of WorldStrides. (For further information regarding travel to your specific destination(s), you are encouraged to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Travelers’ Health website at www.cdc.gov/travel, as well as, if applicable, the State Department’s International Travel website (http://travel.state.gov/travel/)) I hereby acknowledge and understand the risks associated with traveling and voluntarily assume these risks in order to participate in the tour provided by WorldStrides. In addition, I release WorldStrides from its own negligence and assume all risk thereof. My WorldStrides tour begins with the departure of the WorldStrides bus or take-off of the flight from my departure city and ends upon completion of the return flight or WorldStrides bus trip to the United States. Without diminishing Paragraph 1 of this Agreement, I understand that WorldStrides is not responsible for me when I am apart from WorldStrides-organized activities, such as visits to friends or relatives, during free time, or during stay-ahead/stay-behind optional periods if the optional period does not include the services of a WorldStrides Tour Director. If I become ill or incapacitated, WorldStrides, or my Program Leader, may take any action they deem necessary for my safety and wellbeing, including attempting to secure medical treatment and/or transporting me home. I agree to abide by WorldStrides’ regulations and the directions of my Program Leader or WorldStrides’ personnel during my tour. Failure to do so may result in WorldStrides terminating me from the tour immediately. I understand that disobeying such rules or directions is cause for me to be sent home, at my own expense, with no right of refund. I agree to abide by all local laws including those concerning drugs and alcohol. I understand that to abuse or disobey such laws is cause for me to be sent home, at my own expense, with no right of refund. I understand that I will be subject to the laws of the country I am visiting. I understand that I will be required to pay for any phone calls or incidental personal expenses that I incur at hotels, as well as for any damage I cause to hotel rooms or facilities, buses, ferries, trains, or cruise ships. I will indemnify WorldStrides and hold it harmless for any financial liability or obligation which I incur, or injury or damage to the person or property of others which I cause or contribute to, while participating on a WorldStrides tour. I understand that both WorldStrides and my Program Leader reserve the right to refuse or cancel my enrollment for conduct which in either’s sole discretion could impact the participant’s ability to comply with trip regulations or which could impact the group’s enjoyment of the trip and that in any such case standard cancellation fees will apply. WorldStrides has the right to make changes in tour itineraries and departure dates and to modify transportation or lodging arrangements. In the event of changes being made, refunds will be given only in accordance with the provisions of the “WorldStrides Terms and Conditions” supplied herewith. I understand that it is my responsibility to secure all necessary travel documents, including passport, visas, transit visa and any required travel insurance unless specifically arranged for the group by WorldStrides. Failure to do so does not constitute grounds for a refund except according to the normal cancellation guidelines as outlined in the “WorldStrides Terms and Conditions.” I acknowledge my choice to travel with the teacher or Program Leader organizing my group, and I understand that this choice is not the responsibility of WorldStrides. I understand that WorldStrides reserves the right to reassign my group to a replacement teacher or Program Leader should my original Program Leader be unable to, or determine not to, participate in the tour and that the standard cancellation policy will apply if I choose not to travel with the new Program Leader. Any film or video likeness taken of me while participating in a WorldStrides program and any comments or statements made by me while participating in a WorldStrides program may be used in future promotional or other materials published by WorldStrides without payment of any consideration therefor. This agreement, and the Terms & Conditions supplied herewith (collectively, “Agreement”) constitute the entire agreement between WorldStrides and me. I understand that no warranty or representation not herein, including but not limited to any oral statements made to me by agents of WorldStrides or by my school or Program Leader, applies to any WorldStrides tour. This agreement may be amended or modified only in writing, signed by a WorldStrides officer. BINDING ARBITRATION. I agree that any dispute concerning, relating, or referring to this Agreement, the brochure, or any other literature concerning the tour, or the tour itself shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration in Charlottesville, Virginia, according to the then existing commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association. Such proceedings will be governed by substantive (but not procedural) Virginia law. The arbitrator and not any federal, state, or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, conscionability, or formation of this Agreement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.
